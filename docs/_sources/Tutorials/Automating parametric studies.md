# Automating the composite wing model parametric study 

**Duration: 15 min**

Driver components can be used to automate complex analysis workflows.

In this tutorial, we automate the execution of a parametric study using the chained component analyses from the previous example.

## Opening a saved session

Start by loading the session file from the previous example.

Select `Open` from the interface controls to load the JSON formatted version of our previous session (dapta_input.json). 
Alternatively, copy the JSON object below into a text editor and save it locally, then select `Open` to load it. 
Three connected components should appear in the workspace. 

````{dropdown} dapta_input.json
```{literalinclude} ./automating_parametric_studies/dapta_input.json   
:language: json
```
````

The question marks next to the component names indicate that they are missing some data. 
To fully define them, we need to upload all the components' `setup.py`, `compute.py`, `requirements.txt` and user input files, as described in the previous example. 

Here are quick links to the file contents available under the [Chaining component analyses](./Chaining%20component%20analyses.md) example:

* [Parametric model component](tutorials-chained_components-parametric_model-files)
* [Calculix-fea component](tutorials-chained_components-calculix_fea-files)
* [Results processor component](tutorials-chained_components-results_processor-files)

Once the files are uploaded, check that the all components are valid. 
There should be green tick marks next to the component names in the workspace view.


## Automating a parametric study

What is the effect of changing the composite material properties on the deflections at the tip of the wing?

To answer this question, we can perform a parametric study. 
We execute the chained analyses for a range of composite property inputs and record the output average wing tip deflections and rotations.   
This example is based on the pure python implementation in [Reference 1](tutorials-automating-parametric-studies-references). 

### The driver component 

The design variable of interest is the `calculix-fea` input variable `fibre_rotation_angle.ORI_0.1`, which was previously set to zero (fibres aligned with the wing span direction). 
The driver `compute.py` function has to perform the following tasks:

1. iterate over a range of variable values, where the range is defined through the component `Parameters` tab values `rotation_min` (-10 degrees) to `rotation_max` (10 degrees), with increments of `rotation_inc` (5 degrees);
2. in each iteration, the `run_workflow` function is called to execute the chained component analyses with the current variable value;
3. finally, the plotting function (`_plot_study_results`) generates a line plot of the wing tip deflections as a function of variable value.  

```{note}
Note that the `parametric-model` component executes in each workflow iteration, even though it's inputs do not change. 
To reduce the overhead associated with this component, we could move the `parametric-model` compute function logic into the setup function, which is only executed once.  
```

To create the driver component:

* Right-click in the workspace and select `Add Empty Node`. Select the empty component to edit it.

* In the `Properties` tab, fill in the component name, `parametric-study-driver`, and select the component API `generic-python3-driver:latest`. 

* Copy the contents of the `setup.py`, `compute.py`, `requirements.txt` files from below into a text editor, save them locally.
Then upload them under the `Properties` tab. 

* In the `Properties` tab check the box next to the `Driver` option. 

* Copy the contents of the parameters JSON object below into the `Parameters` tab text box. 

* Select `Save data` to save and close the component. 

`````{tab-set}
````{tab-item} setup
```{literalinclude} ./driver-calculix-fea/setup.py
:language: python
```
````
````{tab-item} compute
```{literalinclude} ./driver-calculix-fea/compute.py
:language: python
```
````
````{tab-item} requirements
```{literalinclude} ./driver-calculix-fea/requirements.txt
:language: text
```
````
````{tab-item} parameters
```{literalinclude} ./driver-calculix-fea/parameters.json
:language: json
```
````
`````

### Execute the workflow

We can now execute the parametric study by selecting the play symbol â–¶ in the Run controls interface. 

Once the run has started, each component will setup and then execute one at a time. 
The setup order is arbitrary, but the compute functions will always be executed from the 'Start Node' to the 'End Node' (see dashboard Reference section for details).

The {term}`Run` should complete after 5 iterations of the connected components (or 1 iteration of the `parametric-study-driver` component). 

### Inspect the outputs

The {term}`Run` log summarises the output of the components. Open the log by selecting `View Log` in the interface controls. 

We can see that each component's compute function was executed 5 times. 
The "run_output" (at the end of the log) lists the compute output messages for the 5th workflow iteration only.  

Next, close the {term}`Run` log and select the `parametric-study-driver` component.
Then select the `Log` tab and click on `download files snapshot`.

The parametric study outputs are visibly summarised in the 'results_plot.png' and 'results_plot.png' plots in the 'outputs' folder.

## Clean-up

Delete your session by selecting `New` in the interface. 
It may take a minute or so for the Cloud session to be reset. 

```{warning}
You should see a warning message whenever you are about to delete a {term}`Run`. If you select to continue, then all the {term}`Run` data (session data, inputs and outputs) will be permanently deleted. 
```
